# LibreduckReloaded

## Introduction
Libreduck Reloaded is the sequel to Libreduck on a new codebase.

## What the hell is the difference between Libreduck and Libreduck Reloaded?
Libreduck's codebase was bad. It was full of janky fixes and was held together with duct tape. Even worse, Libreduck used CEFSharp, which is not cross platform. (neither was WinForms, if I remember correctly)

Libreduck Reloaded uses a new codebase with hopefully less janky fixes, and is also cross-platform by using CEFGlue instead of CEFSharp and Avalonia instead of WinForms.
